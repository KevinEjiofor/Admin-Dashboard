# User Management Dashboard

A Vue.js-powered User Management Dashboard designed to streamline the management of user data, search filtering, status categorization, and transaction handling. This project provides a responsive and interactive interface for administrators to view, update, and manage users' payment statuses and other relevant details.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Status Tabs:** Allows filtering users based on payment status (`All`, `Paid`, `Unpaid`, `Overdue`) with a clear, color-coded indicator for each active tab.
- **Search Functionality:** Enables quick user lookup by name or email, simplifying data retrieval and reducing time spent on manual searches.
- **User Payment Management:** Integrates actions for marking users as paid, enabling efficient financial tracking and status updates.
- **Total Payable Calculation:** Displays a summary of total payable amounts with responsive formatting.
- **Reusable Components:** Custom components for user rows and status tabs allow for modular development and easy maintenance.
- **Styling and UX Enhancements:** Sleek, minimalistic UI designed with CSS for a clean and user-friendly experience, featuring active states and hover effects for buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js 3**: Composition API for managing component state and logic.
- **Pinia**: For state management, simplifying global data handling.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for a responsive and visually appealing layout.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run serve`.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand payment actions with more flexible transaction management.
- Improve accessibility and add animations for a smoother user experience.

This project is designed to provide a foundational tool for effective user management and can be easily expanded for larger applications.
